ALL STILL WIP !!!

```bash
mvn clean install
mkdir ~/.code-tracer/
cp src/test/resources/integration/test-config.yaml ~/.code-tracer
```

open `IntegrationTest.java` and run it (see comments in test header)

target application needs to be started with `-noverify` (for the moment)

nothing more here for the moment ....
